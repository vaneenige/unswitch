Unswitch is a tiny (400b) event handler for Switch controllers on the web based on the Gamepad API. Attach callbacks to button presses (up & down) and the joystick!

## Install

```
$ npm install --save unswitch
```

### Including via script tag

You can also include a script tag in your HTML page:

```html
<script src="http://unpkg.com/unswitch"></script>
```

## Setup
Connecting a Switch controller is easy: pair it with bluetooth and you're ready to go! This library doesn't listen to `connected` or `disconnected` events but in some cases it might be useful. Here's how you can listen to these events:

```js
window.addEventListener("gamepadconnected", ({ gamepad }) => {});
```

```js
window.addEventListener("gamepaddisconnected", ({ gamepad }) => {});
```

## Usage

```js
// Import the library
// (This step is unnecessary if you're including via a script tag)
import Unswitch from 'unswitch';

// Create the listener
const unswitch = new Unswitch({
  side: 'L', // or R
  b: (pressed) => {},
  a: (pressed) => {},
  y: (pressed) => {},
  x: (pressed) => {},
  l: (pressed) => {},
  r: (pressed) => {},
  minus: (pressed) => {},
  plus: (pressed) => {},
  lstick: (pressed) => {},
  rstick: (pressed) => {},
  home: (pressed) => {},
  screenshot: (pressed) => {},
  side: (pressed) => {}, // The 'Side' button near ZL or ZR
  z: (pressed) => {}, // ZL or ZR
  axes: (position) => {},
});

function render() {
  // Check for button stateupdates
  unswitch.update();
  requestAnimationFrame(render);
}

render();
```

It's possible to connect up to two controllers at the same time. To make this work `side` is to be passed with either `L` (left) or `R` (right) for the controllers respectively. Calling `unswitch.update()` will check every button for a change in state. If a callback is provided the new state is passed along. The axis works in the same way, but instead of a `boolean` it will return a `number` from 0 to 8. Number 0 to 7 are for the joystick positions going clockwise, number 8 is used as default (center).

> Buttons are mapped based on a single controller positioned horizontally.
